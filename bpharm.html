 <div class="title"><span>Future Scope</span></div>
 							<div>
							
	<p style="color:#FF3366">Now that almost everything modern has been introduced to pharmacy, not only its scope has widened but also the future of those who are into this industry has become secure. This area of practice offers chances for detailed research and development. More importantly, pharmacy graduates are facilitated in every way possible to carry out research work on various aspects of pharmacy. The line of areas in which to research may include IPR (Intellectual Property Right), DRA (Drug Regulatory Affairs), NDDS (New Drug Delivery System) etc.
 </p><br/><p style="color:#FF3366">
Also, there are other areas such as Community Pharmacy, Clinical Pharmacy, Hospital Pharmacy, Health-system Pharmacy, Nuclear Pharmacy and Industrial Pharmacy to get into. By reputation, all these segments provide plenty of opportunities for growth and even more importantly, are sufficiently lucrative. B.Pharmacy enables candidates to serve the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Veterans Administration, the Public Health Service, the Armed Forces, the National Institutes of Health, and many other government agencies.
 </p><br/><p style="color:#FF3366">
Moreover, there are full-of-scope sectors like Pharmaceutical Journalism and Organizational Management. Pharmaceutical Journalism is for limited number of pharmacists where they can exhibit their writing and editing skills. On the other hand, Organizational Management offers pharmacists national and state association and on boards of pharmacy. There is career for them in insurance sector also. There they can work on managerial positions with health and welfare agencies. Since this no doubt is more than enough, no question of future insecurity of pharmacy industry arises.
